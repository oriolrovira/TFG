Description: Procedure for assigning a relevance measure to each explanatory variable in a complex predictive model. 
	     We have a training set to fit the model and a test set to check the out of sample performance. 
	     The individual relevance of each variable is computed by comparing in the test set the predictions of the model that includes all the variables,
	     with those of another model in which the variable of interest is substituted by its ghost variable, 
	     defined as the prediction of this variable by using the rest of explanatory variables. 
	     Furthermore, we check the joint relevance of the variables by using the eigenvalues of a relevance matrix that is the covariance matrix of
	     the vectors of individual effects.
